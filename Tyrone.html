<h1> Chapter l: The Legend</h1>


<p><mark> Children of North Dakota have heard rumors for years of children and teachers going missing. Many who heard these tales heard that they were just stories told to scare the kids into behaving and being respectful, in fear that TYRONE might get them!
Tyrone was Said to once be a teacher at one of the high schools in southern North Dakota, he was a kind hearted and playful man. He was Kinda scary too as he was very large. Tyrone was originally apart of an African tribe called the chiggs. But then one day the Principle of the school Mr Sneeg, Took Tyrone into his office after school... he told Tyrone he wanted to talk in private when no one was around. Tyrone thought he was being promoted so he was eager and excited to have "the talk". But Tyrone was in for way more than he anticipated... Mr Sneeg took Tyrone and pushed him in the vent. He quickly drilled back the entrance to the vent and locked tyrone away forever. Tyrone was trapped in the vent and ever since has been seeking revenge, as well as food. Eating whatever he could get a hold of.... Including the children. </mark> </p>
